Title: Modeling the Interplay Between Light Signaling and Drought Stress in Plant Development  

In the context of climate change, understanding how plants integrate environmental and hormonal signals to regulate their growth is an urgent need. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the elongation of the hypocotyl, the plant's embryonic stem, is controlled by light and modulated by temperature through a molecular axis involving COP1–ELF3–phyB–PIFs. The mathematical model of Nieto et al. (2022) effectively captures this light-temperature integration and predicts elongation under various photothermal regimes. 

Recently, Cañibano et al. (2025) showed that hypocotyl elongation is sensitive to the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). The ABA is a central regulator of the abiotic stress response and of development: it participates in seed dormancy, drought resistance, stomatal closure, and control of cell elongation, among other processes.

The growth of seedlings grown in light is sensitive to ABA, while in darkness, etiolated seedlings are insensitive to ABA inhibition, despite the activation of a canonical repertoire of ABA-responsive genes. This result suggests divergent pathways between ABA-induced transcriptional regulation and elongation control in darkness, with a role for the PIF–SAUR–PP2C.D module in safeguarding elongation against ABA.

This Master's thesis will extend the model of Nieto et al. to incorporate ABA inhibition, drawing on the biology and data of Cañibano et al. and adjusting/validating with that data. This aims to achieve a quantitative understanding of the light-ABA interaction in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation, aligned with the competencies of the Master's in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (modeling of ODEs, fitting to data and reproducible analysis).
